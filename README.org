* Welcome!
A lisp code base that imports a ppm! You can use [[https://www.online-utility.org/image/convert/to/PPM][this]] to convert a png file to ppm file(I also included an ImageMagick guide in line). [[https://www.cs.rhodes.edu/welshc/COMP141_F16/ppmReader.html][This website]] lets you view the ppm file output.

The following are screenshots of what it does:

Here's my input image (some pretty fanart (credit goes to amalia v) of a character I like):
