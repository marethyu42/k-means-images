* Welcome!
A lisp code base that imports a ppm! You can use [[https://www.online-utility.org/image/convert/to/PPM][this]] to convert a png file to ppm file(I also included an ImageMagick guide in line). [[https://www.cs.rhodes.edu/welshc/COMP141_F16/ppmReader.html][This website]] lets you view the ppm file output.

The following are screenshots of what it does:

Here's my input image (some pretty fanart (credit goes to amalia v) of a character I like):

And eventually turns into this! (k-means imaged!!):


With 6 clusters

With 13 clusters

With 30 clusters

* How Image Segmentation works vs K-Means Image Segmentation

Classical image segmentation in Computer Vision utilizes a lot more machine learning than any of my work, as I'm using a principle of Machine Learning, but one that's using the image as the sole dataset, while other programs utilize a wide birth of pre-existing training data for detecting varying objects.
Alternatively, different methods like: thresholding (detecting if pixels are above or below a value), edge detection (to find boundaries of objects—which is a goal of mine to use for this project, too), watersheds (creating a topographical map of valleys/ridges), region based methods (creating adaptive algorithms that "comb" their way through the image, checking similarities), or more!
